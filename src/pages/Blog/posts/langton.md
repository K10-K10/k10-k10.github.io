I added a new page about Langton's Ant.
It was my first time creating a program using JavaScript,
and I learned a lot from it.
It was difficult to make it display quickly.

I want to be able to change the speed and display size.
I might also add the “Game of Life.”
But, I don't know how to change colour in touched grid;;
I should have to learn more...
